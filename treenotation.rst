What is tree notation:

It is a way Tree Notation is a simple new notation for writing code and data. Tree Notation brings code to life, by giving it physical dimensions. Tree Notation is code you could hold.


In other words, you can use tree notation to write code or use its structure data.

Are there any practical examples of tree notations?

Yes, the scroll is a domain specific language of tree notations to build and compile websites (https://github.com/breck7/scroll) while PLDB uses scroll to create websites and store its data in tree notation too (https://github.com/breck7/pldb)

Other examples include https://github.com/breck7/slots, https://github.com/breck7/patch and https://github.com/breck7/swarm

They are more than just practical examples of treenotations, they are deployed
D solutions.


Can I see the source of tree notation implementation?
Sure, it is at https://github.com/breck7/jtree


Can I use tree notation in my favorite language?
Please scroll down the page  https://treenotation.org/ and look at https://github.com/breck7/swim/issues for latest information.


Can you explain treenotation grammer in 5 minutes?
Sure I can try.

Each record is represented by a node. Each node has a key and value pair. Each node has key word cell and value cell of certain or any time, at minimum

Becuase this is a key and value databse with encahancements, we need grammers.Grammers tell you how value cell of a node is an extention of a particular node or it tells how the value cell can be composed of other key cell/value cell pairs (other sub nodes) instead of just value cell.

Get that a value can je be a value cell or contain another node containing key and value pair, isnt that something ?
