Keys like keys like semanticScholar, reference, website, Wikipedia, githubRepo,twitter, ubuntuPackage help create more keys, value pairs or helps crawlers find more key, value pairs. They can be called meta keys.

 relational keys like help in defining related entries: forkOf, subsetOf, supersetOf, related, influencedBy, successorOf, etc.

writtenIn, compilesTo keys value should be the title of a project entry present in pldb. but can we make a key that depends on keys like oldName, renamedTo instead of just title  keys value ??

Can treenotation support relation or foreign keys that can depend on something other than title. If the value of a key points to another table entry it is relational. If the value of a key is itself the value of another table entryes key-value pairs value, its a foreign key. Foreign keys help in limiting errors or reduce the cost of making mass changes. it could also reduce the size of databases.

TLDR: Lists are used to convert normal key- value pair to tagged search like feature. Lists Should have the ability to test if the database entries have valid values. 


These are used to create pages like https://pldb.com/lists/lists.html and https://pldb.com/lists/features.html 

Each of these lists has a landing page: which provide all results to the tagged search. Each tag can have its own results like https://pldb.com/languages/namespace-feature.html or it cannot like in https://pldb.com/lists/originCommunities.html

tag keys are like foreign keys or relational keys but their value is not dependent on keys or values of other pairs.
tags as strings inlcude keys like lineCommentToken, printToken, and stringToken

tag keys as binary can also inlcude keys like features subkeys like
 hasHereDocs ,  hasPrintDebugging ,  hasStrings ,   "Hello world"

tag key as enumeration include key : type can this enum type be generated dyunamically ?? Can i get a list of enumerated tags used in curent database ??

Can lists be used to define the values of foreign keys, if so how ??
For example https://pldb.com/posts/originCountries11-3-2022.html can be used to create appropriate foreign keys.


The notation should also describe which keys are required, which are optional.

Can i get a quality score for pldb files in my DB ??

In theory it should be possible by seeing how many additional keys can be added using meta keys.


Currently in pldb lists are generated during npm build command
